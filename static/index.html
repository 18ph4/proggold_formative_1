      <h2>
        What is Cyber Security?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber attack.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>
        Main Types Of Data Threats      
      </h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        1. Malware:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Also known as malicious code/malicious software. program inserted into a system to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Done secretly and can affect your data, applications, operating system. Can cause widespread damage and disruption, and requires huge efforts within most organisations. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Different Types of Malware:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Viruses - programs that can replicate themselves with intention of deleting or corrupting files causing computer to malfunction. Need an active host program that has already been infected to run.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worms - Stand-alone virus that can replicate themselves with intention to spread to other computers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Logic Bombs - Code embedded in a program on a computer, when certain conditions are met (certain time etc.) they carry out set tasks such as deleting files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trojan - Malicious program often disguised as legitimtate software. Intends to carry out harm on the computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bots (internal robots) - Not always harmful and can be used for good purposes, but can cause harm if they take over the computer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spyware - Software gather information by monitoring something like a keyboard (keylogger), microphone etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Tips for prevention:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Require e-mail file attachments to be scanned and saved to local drives or removable media.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't allow certain types of files (e.g., .exe files) to be send or received by e-mail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restrict removable media, such as CDs or flash drives, on systems that are high risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit number of users with administrator level-access or privileges.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure systems are updated regularly with operating system and application upgrades and patches.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>
        2. Ransomware:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prevents/limits users from accessing their system via malware. Ransomware asks you to pay a ransom using and online payment method to regain access to your system/data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Online payments ussually can involve virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Enters computer networks and encrypts files usign public-key encryption. This encryption stays on the cyber criminal's server. the Criminal will request a ransom for this private key.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hard to detect and continuously evolving. Prevention effors include training for employees and strong information security controls.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>
        3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with excessive traffic from many locations and sources. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Website response time slows down, preventing access during a DDoS attack. Cyber criminals deveop a large network of infected computers called Botnets by planting Malware.
        </li>
        <li>
          A DDoS attack is often used as a distraction while other types of fraud are taking place.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>
        4. Spam & Phishing:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spam includes unwanted, unsolicited, or undesirable messages and emails. Phishing is a form of social engineering, including attempts to get sensitive information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phishing attempts will appear to be from a trustworthy source. Cyber criminals pretend to be an official representative sending you an email or message with a warning related to your account info.
        </li>
        <li>
          Message will often ask for response by following a link to a fake website or email address in attempt to steal your personal details. Email is in a format which gives the impression of a legitimate website/email.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>
        5. Corporate Account Takeover (CATO):
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A business entity theft where cyber thieves impersonate the business and send unauthorized wire and ACH transactions. Unauthorized funds are sent to accounts controlled by the cyber criminal.
        </li>
        <li>
          This form of cyber crime can result in large losses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>  
        6. Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Cash Out:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Type of large dollar value ATM fraud. Cash-outs involve simultaneous large cash withdrawals from several ATMs in many regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cash Out usually affects small to medium sized financial institutions. the attack involves changing the settings on ATM web-based control panels. Cyber criminals change ATM's dispense function control to "unlimited operations".
        </li>
        <li>
          "Unlimited operations" allows withdrawal of funds over the customer's account balance or beyond the ATM's cash limit. Stolen ATM or debit card info is often used to withdraw the funds.
        </li>
      </ul>
